I wanted to learn about the banking systems, so this is a naive approach towards implementing the whole banking ecosystem. The application allows users to create accounts, transfer money, manage cards, and view transactions, among other core banking operations.

## Overview
This project is being built using `React` for the frontend, `Java` for core banking services and `Rust` for high-performance components. Thanks to `Aslam Dhikrullahi`, whose [Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1221125094023544484) served as inspiration for the web interface, the UI/UX offers an intuitive experience for all users.

## Features
- `User Account Management`: Registration, login, KYC verification, and profile updates.
- `Account Services`: Create and manage accounts, view balances and transactions.
- `Transfers`: Cash trasnfer between accounts.
- `Card Services`: Issue and manage virtual cards, block/reissue cards.
- `Card Payments`: FakeShop also included to pay using cardi.
